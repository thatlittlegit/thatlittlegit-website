Hey!

Recently had an interesting conversation with Cleverbot. I
said 'ok' repeatedly (so much that the page told me to say
something new, so I changed punctuation, thus the change from
'Ok.' to 'Ok!'), and it started talking about Minecraft and
Call Me Maybe. The script is below, [and also in a Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/raw/rvQtvDrp).

```
