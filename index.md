Hi! I'm thatlittlegit. I code a variety of projects, mainly in POSIX Shell,
AWK, C++, JavaScript and Java.

## my setup
I have three operating systems: Windows 10 (which I almost never use), a
variant of Cucumber Linux developed for a school project, and Debian (my daily
driver).

I use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) with [st](https://st.suckless.org) daily; I use [Atom](https://atom.io) and [NeoVim](https://neovim.org) for text editing and a Solarized theme.

As for hardware, I have an Acer Aspire E1-572P, with an Intel Core i5-4200U
and *Intel HD GRAPHIX!* It has 1TB of disk, though, and 12GB RAM, so it's
not really that bad.

## my projects
I made a [whole page](https://thatlittlegit.github.io/projects) about my projects.

### plans
*Note: this will likely be out-of-date. Last updated: 18-01-29*

- A operating system builder for Linux (and maybe, eventually, kFreeBSD). It'd
  have a concept of 'packages': it would be built with a Makefile, and you
  may use command-line arguments and a config file to pick packages. For
  example:
  ```c
        PKGSRC(https://github.com/thatlittlegit/osb_pkgs)

        ALL_STAGES(binutils)

        STAGE1(tinycc)
        STAGE1(linuxapi)
        STAGE1(musl)

        // ...
		```

- An [unhosted](https://unhosted.org) webapp.
- A cryptocurrency in Rust. Trade 1 unit (let's say XAC) for 1 USD/CAD to
  keep a low price. Don't use proof-of work. Maybe proof-of-burn or whatever?
